Description: 
    The package allows rendering rasterstacks (i.e. 3D data cube) into animations 
    of coloured surfaces. Was intended for animations of global variables like
    carbon cycle at ~0.5deg, but eventually is more general. Heavily depends
    on rgl, rayshader, raster, and can almost be considered a 
    convenience wrapper.
