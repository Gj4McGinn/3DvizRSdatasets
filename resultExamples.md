| Terrestrial gross primary production  | ![GPPSphereWithOcean_00001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26135626/141672744-67422901-ecf4-4aee-8d8b-6d0eb2aff2a6.png) | Shown is the seasonal cycle, which is also metaphorically called "breathing of the biosphere". The data has been spatially smoothed with a gaussian filter, and monthly values interpolated temporally.

| Net ecosystem exchange land and ocean  | ![EarthNEEMSC_00001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26135626/141675483-33371446-5b04-467b-928e-87ac8b47bd60.png) | Shown is the seasonal cycle of net ecosystem exchange, on land and ocean. The data has been spatially smoothed with a gaussian filter, and monthly values interpolated temporally. Data have been log-transformed to make the smaller ocean flux densities visible [[MP4 download]](https://nextcloud.bgc-jena.mpg.de/s/eN89QftYytowy3E) | [Zscheischler, J. et al.: An empirical spatiotemporal description of the global surface-atmosphere Carbon fluxes: opportunities and data limitations, Biogeosciences, 10.5194/bg-2016-427, 2017.](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/14/3685/2017/)
