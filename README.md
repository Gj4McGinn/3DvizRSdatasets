3D Rendering routines for Earth data sets

This (very simple) repo contains code that generates and links that points to visualizations (mostly animations) of Earth System Data Sets, with emphasis on global data sets which have been derived from observational data with machine-learning approaches within the [Department of Biogeochemical Integration](www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/bgi) at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry. [and is my sandbox with github (won't become sophisticated)]

Respective links can be found [here](resultExamples.md) actually.
